<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently learning about becoming a Web Developer. Getting a better
  understanding of langauges such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also things like
  node and react! My understanding of these languages is improving daily as I'm
  taking the crucial steps to become skillful at this craft.
</p>

<p>
  I originally graduated from university with a degree in Marketing. As time
  went on I made the realization that Marketing was not something I was truly
  interested in. I found more enjoyment in computers and technology,
  specifically working with Web Development. My goal is to eventually find a job
  within this career and continue my learning and education while mastering all
  sorts of languages!
</p>

<p>
  My skills and knowledge make me an asset to any company or person that is
  looking to expand their team. I also am a person that once they like
  something, they put their all into it!
